\begin{theorem}
	Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$.
	Then $(HN)/N \isomorphism H/(H\cap N)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ and let $\gamma : G \to G/N$ be the canonical homomorphism.
	Then the map $\phi$ from the set of normal subgroups of $G$ containing $N$ to the set of normal subgroup of $G/N$ given by $\phi(L) = \gamma[L]$ is one-to-one and onto.
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
	If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $H \cap N = HN = NH$.
	Furthermore, if $H$ is also normal in $G$, then $HN$ is normal in $G$.
